# ReadMe for Grad-Cam and its corresponding permutation test
## cnn_grad_cam.ipynb
For Q4, use the cnn_grad_cam.ipynb file. Be sure to download our trained model from the polybox that is linked in the notebook. The ten images we used for visualisation can also be found in a polybox. The link is also at the beginning of the notebook. Make sure that you specify all paths correctly. The pictures on polybox are in a folder called 'img_for_saliency' and are grouped into subfolders based on their classes for the 'ImageFolder' to assign labels correctly.
The "CNN_grad_cam" class and all other functionality are defined in the grad_cam.py file, and make sure the functions you are using in the notebook are imported from this file.

# grad_cam_permutation_test.ipynb

For the permutation test for Grad-Cam in Q5, you need the grad_cam_permutation_test.ipynb file. This notebook builds on the permutated model and 10 test images. For all those two components, you can find the link to a polybox at the beginning of the notebook. Ensure the folder structure is correct so the models are correctly imported and the 'ImageFolder' assigns the labels correctly. Again, from the grad_cam.py file, you need the class "CNN_grad_cam" and the function display_datasets_heatmap to visualise the Grad-Cam saliency maps with the permuted model.
