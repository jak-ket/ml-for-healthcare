# Time Series and Representation Learning

## Part 1

### Q3: Recurrent Neural Networks
Code to train RNN with LSTM can be found in `rnn.ipynb` and `rnn.py` contains model class and training function. 

### Q5: Attention and Transformers
Code to train the Transformer and visualize the attention maps can be found in `transformer.ipynb`. The model classes and training function can be found in `transformer.py`.

## Part 2

### Q4: Fine-tuning Strategies
The notebook `fine_tuning_encoder_q1.ipynb` contains code for classic ML and MLP strategies using encoder from Q1 and `fine_tuning_encoder_q2.ipynb` using encoder from Q2 (Autoencoder).
